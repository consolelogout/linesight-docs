Our goal is to create an AI that can learn to play *Trackmania Nations Forever* at a world-class level using reinforcement learning. We’ve already obtained significant results as showcased in the video below. Our AI was able to beat ten out of twelve prestigious world records in the official Trackmania campaign.

We’re excited to open-source our code. Whether you are a Trackmania enthusiast or a seasoned AI researcher, you may use the project to train your own AI. We welcome contributions to help push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in Trackmania.
