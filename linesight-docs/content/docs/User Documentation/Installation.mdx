# Prerequisites

### Linesight requires:
- Python >=3.10 and < 3.12
- PyTorch >=2.1 with CUDA (check the [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for specific instructions)
- 20 GB RAM
- [Trackmania Nations Forever](https://store.steampowered.com/app/11020/TrackMania_Nations_Forever/) with [ModLoader](https://tomashu.dev/software/tmloader/) and [TMInterface 2.1.0](https://www.donadigo.com/tminterface/).

This project is compatible with Windows and Linux. The authors use Nvidia GPUs, but user reports indicate that the project is also compatible with AMD GPUs.

# Python project setup

Clone the repository and install the project.

To avoid outdated package versions, we recommend setting the project up in a clean virtual environment (conda, mamba, pipenv, …).

### conda / mamba

If using conda or mamba, the following commands will set the project up.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pb4git/linesight && cd linesight
conda create -n linesight python=3.11
conda activate linesight
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia # from pytorch website
conda install --file requirements_conda.txt
pip install -e .
```

### pip

In all other cases, use the following commands to set the project in your chosen environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pb4git/linesight && cd linesight
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 # from pytorch website
pip install -e .
```

## Linux-specific instructions

In the folder ``/scripts/``, create a bash script that takes an integer ``port`` as its single argument. The script n the folder /scripts/, create a bash script that takes an integer port as its single argument. The script should start the game configured to listen on port port for TMInterface communications. The scripts ``/scripts/launch_game_pb.sh`` and ``/scripts/launch_game_agade.sh`` are working examples on the authors’ systems.
